Eco-Car

MGMT 590 R Shiny App Project final.
Our app would help American consumers to find the most cost-efficient and eco-friendly in the market. 
Users can input desirable features (year, budgets, mpg, fuel cost per year, door, luggage volume and more) to find the suitable options (automaker and model)
